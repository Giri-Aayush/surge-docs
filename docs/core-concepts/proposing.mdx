# Prover Setup

Surge supports two types of provers for block verification:

## Nethermind TEE Prover

The Nethermind TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) Prover leverages secure hardware enclaves for block verification. This prover is currently in development with the following features:

- Attestation extraction and verification
- RPC snooping for payload execution interception
- TD (Transaction Data) attestations for block verification
- Smart contract integration for attestation verification

### Components

1. **RPC Snooper**: Intercepts payload executions between CL-EL
2. **Attestation System**: Stores and verifies payload executions
3. **TDX Verifier**: Integrates with core rollup contracts
4. **Cloud Deployment**: Supports both Azure and GCP environments

### Setup Requirements

- Intel TDX-compatible hardware
- Secure enclave configuration
- Network connectivity to L1 and L2 nodes

:::note
Detailed setup instructions will be provided once the TEE prover development is complete.

## RethZk Prover

The RethZk Prover is an alternative proving system based on zero-knowledge proofs. This system is designed to provide:

- High performance block verification
- Compatible with Ethereum's execution environment
- Efficient proof generation and verification

### Key Features

- Zero-knowledge proof generation
- Optimized for EVM compatibility
- Scalable proof verification

:::note Development Status
The RethZk Prover is currently under active development. Setup instructions and deployment guides will be provided upon completion.

## Prover Economics

Provers play a crucial role in the Surge ecosystem and are compensated through:

- A share of base fees from transaction processing
- Additional rewards for timely proof generation
- Performance-based incentives

For detailed information about prover compensation and economics, please refer to the [Core Concepts](/docs/core-concepts) section.
