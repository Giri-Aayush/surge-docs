# Deploy L2

This guide walks you through the process of deploying the L2 network components using Simple Surge Node.

## Setup Process

### 1. Clone Repository

First, clone the Simple Surge Node repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/simple-surge-node.git
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create and configure your environment file:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

:::tip Environment Configuration
Edit your `.env` file with the appropriate machine address where you deployed the Kurtosis package. Example configuration:

```env
L1_ENDPOINT_WS=ws://185.3.95.99:32003
L1_BEACON_HTTP=http://185.3.95.99:33001
```

Make sure to replace the IP address and ports with your actual deployment values.
:::

### 3. Start Components

The deployment consists of three main components that need to be started in sequence:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="driver" label="Driver" default>

        ```bash
        docker compose -f docker-compose.yml --profile nethermind_execution_l2 up -d
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="proposer" label="Proposer">

        ```bash
        docker compose -f docker-compose.yml --profile proposer up -d
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="prover" label="Prover Relayer">

        ```bash
        docker compose -f docker-compose-prover.yml --profile prover up -d
        ```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Verification

After starting all components, you should:

1. Check that all Docker containers are running properly
2. Monitor the logs for any startup errors
3. Verify network connectivity between components

:::info Component Order
It's important to start the components in the specified order:

1. Driver
2. Proposer
3. Prover Relayer

This sequence ensures proper initialization and communication between components.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Verify all environment variables are correctly set
- Check Docker logs for specific error messages
- Ensure all required ports are accessible
- Confirm network connectivity between components
