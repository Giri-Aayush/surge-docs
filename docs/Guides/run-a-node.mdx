# Run a Node

This guide will help you start up a Surge RPC node using simple-surge-node.

## Prerequisites

### Software

Be sure to have the following software installed:

- `git` version 2.x or higher
- `docker` version 24.0 or higher
- `docker compose` version 2.x or higher

### Hardware

Any modern computer with 2 cores CPU and 4GB RAM will be sufficient.

## Run a Surge node with simple-surge-node

### 1. Clone simple-surge-node repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/simple-surge-node
cd simple-surge-node
```

### 2. Create your .env file

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Edit the .env file to set the correct values for your environment.

```bash
nano .env
```

The following environment variables need to be configured:

- `L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP`: HTTP endpoint for your L1 node
- `L1_ENDPOINT_WS`: WebSocket endpoint for your L1 node
- `L1_BEACON_HTTP`: Beacon chain HTTP endpoint

You need to provide locally running L1 node endpoints or use a public L1 node.

Examples:
```bash
# Local L1 node
L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP=http://192.168.1.10:8545
L1_ENDPOINT_WS=ws://192.168.1.10:8546
L1_BEACON_HTTP=http://192.168.1.10:5052

# Using Infura
L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR-PROJECT-ID
L1_ENDPOINT_WS=wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws/v3/YOUR-PROJECT-ID
L1_BEACON_HTTP=https://beacon.infura.io
```

### 3. Run docker compose to start the node

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

That's it! The apropriate images will be downloaded and docker services will be started.

### 4. Verify Node Health

You can verify your node is running correctly by:

1. Checking if blocks are being synced:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8547 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```

2. Monitoring the dashboard at http://localhost:3001/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview

3. Checking service logs:
```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## Stop the node

Stop the node with command:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To remove the volumes and start fresh next time:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
