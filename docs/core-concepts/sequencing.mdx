# Sequencer Guide

The Surge sequencer is responsible for processing transactions and managing block production on the L2 network. This guide explains how the sequencer works and its fee structure.

## Overview

The sequencer:

- Orders and executes user transactions
- Manages block production
- Handles fee distribution
- Maintains L2 chain efficiency

## Fee Structure

### Base Fee Distribution

- 75% goes to the coinbase address
- 25% goes to the treasury
- Distribution is handled through the proving mechanism

### Priority Fees

- 100% of priority fees go to the coinbase
- Proposers can provide additional tips during block proposal on L1

### Fee Components

1. **Base Fee**: Automatically adjusted based on network congestion
2. **Priority Fee**: Optional tip to incentivize faster inclusion
3. **Extra Tips**: Additional proposer incentives for L2 PBS (Proposer Builder Separation)

:::note
Fee distribution is built into the proving mechanism rather than handled by smart contracts.
:::

## Block Production

The sequencer manages block production with the following parameters:

- Configurable target gas per block
- Adjustable base fee calculations
- Flexible fee distribution ratios

## Configuration

Sequencer operators can adjust various parameters including:

- Target gas limits
- Fee sharing percentages
- Block production rates
- Priority fee minimums

:::tip
Always monitor system metrics when adjusting sequencer parameters to maintain optimal performance.

## Advanced Features

- Custom executor implementation
- Configurable base fee sharing
- Support for proposer builder separation
- Flexible treasury management
